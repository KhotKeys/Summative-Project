# Student Reflection Page - GitHub Pages

This repository contains a multilingual student reflection portal that can be easily deployed on GitHub Pages.

## 🌐 Live Demo
The student reflection page is automatically deployed at: `https://khotkeys.github.io/Summative-Project/`

## 📁 GitHub Pages Files
The following files in the root directory power the GitHub Pages deployment:

- `index.html` - Main HTML page for the student reflection portal
- `styles.css` - Styling and responsive design
- `index.js` - JavaScript functionality and form handling
- `translations.js` - Multi-language support (English/French)

## 🚀 Deployment
GitHub Pages automatically deploys from the root directory when you:
1. Push changes to the `master` branch
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select "Deploy from branch" → `master` → `/ (root)`

## ✨ Features
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices
- 🌍 Multi-language support (English/French)
- 💾 Auto-save drafts to localStorage
- ✅ Form validation and submission

## 🔧 Local Development
To test locally:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Or use a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000`

The page works entirely in the browser with no backend requirements for GitHub Pages deployment.
